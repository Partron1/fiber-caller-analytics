## Fiber Call Center Analytics 
This project highlights my Business Intelligence solution to support the Google Fiber Customer Service Team with a dashboard designed to gain insights into repeat callers.


**Business Problem**

The teamâ€™s ultimate goal is to communicate with the customers to reduce the call volume and increase customer satisfaction and improve operational optimization. 

**Project Requirment Documents**

After a collaborative project meeting, I outlined three key requirement documents that shaped the scope and direction of the solution.

- Stakeholder requirement document
- Project requirement document
- Strategy requirement document

**Data source**
The project started with three cleaned datasets provided by the data engineer. Although they came from different sources, the columns were standardized, making them ready for analysis.
